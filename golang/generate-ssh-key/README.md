# Generate an SSH Key in Golang

The code in this directory was heavily derived from [this StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21151714/go-generate-an-ssh-public-key).

This was written and tested with Golang 1.18 on an ARM64-based Mac, but it should run fine on any platform or architecture supported by Go.
