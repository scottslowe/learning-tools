# Learning Tools: rkt ("Rocket") Container Runtime

This folder contains tools, resources, and environments for working with `rkt`, the CoreOS container runtime.

**NOTE:** The `rkt` runtime is no longer actively developed, and CoreOS was acquired by Red Hat. The code, examples, and configurations found in this folder very likely do not work.

## Contents

**rkt-ubuntu**: This folder contains the files to work with `rkt` (version 1.4.0), the CoreOS implementation of the App Container (appc) specification, on Ubuntu 14.04. Provisioning is handled by Vagrant's file and shell provisioners.
